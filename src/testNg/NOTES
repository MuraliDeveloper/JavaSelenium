 - In TestNG, NG stands for "Next Generation".
- TestNG  an open source automated Testing frameworK
- is a test engine using which we will run the test cases.
- use annotations for writing the test cases.
-  provides full control over the test cases and the execution of the test cases. 
- TestNG has more powerful and flexible test cases with help of easy annotations, grouping, sequencing and parametrizing.



TestNG annotations:
-------------------------------
It supports multithreaded execution.
It provides flexible test configuration.
It also supports the parameters.
It is supported by various tools and plug-ins such as Eclipse, Maven, IDEA, etc.
It supports Data-driven testing with the help of @DataProvider.


Adv:
In TestNG, annotations are easier to understand than Junit.
It produces the HTML reports for implementation.
It also generates the Logs.
Parallel execution of test cases, 
i.e., running multiple test cases is only possible in the TestNG framework.
It allows you to run the test cases of a particular group. 
    Let's consider a scenario where we have created two groups such as 'Smoke' and 'Regression'. If you want to execute the test cases in a 'Regression' group, then this can only be possible in the TestNG framework.
TestNG enables you to group the test cases easily which is not possible in JUnit.

TestNG supports three additional levels such as @Before/After suite, @Before/AfterTest, and Before/AfterGroup.
TestNG does not extend any class. TestNG framework allows you to define the test cases where each test case is independent of other test cases.
In TestNG, there is no constraint available such as @beforeclass and @afterclass which is present in Junit.

TestNG Annotation:
-------------  
@BeforeSuite
The annotated method will be run only once before all tests in this suite have run.

@AfterSuite
The annotated method will be run only once after all tests in this suite have run.

@BeforeClass
The annotated method will be run only once before the first test method in the current class is invoked.

@AfterClass
The annotated method will be run only once after all the test methods in the current class have run.

@BeforeTest
The annotated method will be run before any test method belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag is run.

@AfterTest
The annotated method will be run after all the test methods belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag have run.

@BeforeGroups
The list of groups that this configuration method will run before. This method is guaranteed to run shortly before the first test method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.

@AfterGroups
The list of groups that this configuration method will run after. This method is guaranteed to run shortly after the last test method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.

@BeforeMethod
The annotated method will be run before each test method.

@AfterMethod
The annotated method will be run after each test method.

@DataProvider
Marks a method as supplying data for a test method. The annotated method must return an Object[ ][ ], where each Object[ ] can be assigned the parameter list of the test method. The @Test method that wants to receive data from this DataProvider needs to use a dataProvider name equals to the name of this annotation.

 
@Parameters
Describes how to pass parameters to a @Test method.

@Test
Marks a class or a method as a part of the test.

@Factory
Marks a method as a factory that returns objects that will be used by TestNG as Test classes. The method must return Object[ ].


@Listeners
Defines listeners on a test class.

Order of execution of annotations:
-----------------------------------
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite

syntax for test method:
-------------------------

  @Test
  public void test1(){
  
  
  }
 - Every test method has @Test annotation before the method declaration


  
syntax of Test class:
-----------------------

public class MyTest {

	@Test
	public void T1() {
 
   <some test code here>
  }


	@Test
	public void T2() {
 
  <some test code here>
  }
  
  
 	@Test
	public void T3() {
 <some test code here>
  
  }


}
run the test classes using test ng
