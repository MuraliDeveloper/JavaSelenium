page object model:
------------------------

There are two types of classes:
- page class  [for every web page]
- test classes [for every web page]




1.for every page there is a page class
2.the page class contains
   - instance variables 
      [web element objects]
   - methods
      [every operation on the page ]
      - verifictaion
      - any action 
      
page class should contain the logic for :
 A> identifying the webelements
 B> any action on web element
 
   so far the A & B is writteen in test class.
    if we write in test class it is diffcult for reusabilty.
    that why we are moving the logic to the page class.
     
Steps:
----------------
1.create the page class
   -> write all webelements
   -> write all the methods
2.Create the test class
  -> create the object for page class
  -> call the methods using the pafe object
  
  

 create two packages:
-> pages
-> tests
