Regression is costly + time consuming.
Perf testing follows after Regression.

Order:
--------
-> Test New Features (using test cases)
-> Test Defects  (ReTesting )
-> Regression  ------> Heavy + costly + time consuming.
-> Non Funtional Testing
-> UAT (customer)

Introduce additional testing for Time saving:
-> Test New Features (using test cases)
-> Test Defects (ReTesting)
-> Smoke + Sanity Testing 
-> Regression  ------> Heavy + costly + time consuming.
-> Non Functional Testing
-> UAT (customer)



Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing:
-------------------------------------

Smoke:
-------
- mostly done using the tool.
- Build verification testing.
- check if the new build is stable.
- verify the app lauched successfully or is the deployment success and check  installation is proper or check if the pages are responsive (in time/not at all).
- verify critical funtionality.
->Minor changes/fixes .
->if Smoke fails , then no need to go for regresion and create HIGH defect.


Sanity :
-----------
->UAT TESTING done by tester.
->basic navigation, basic flow testing .
->Minor changes/fixes .
->if sanity fails , then no need to go for regresion and create defect.
